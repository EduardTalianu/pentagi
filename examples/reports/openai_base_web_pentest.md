# Vulnerability Assessment Plan for Web Application at http://10.10.10.10:8080

1. **Collect All Endpoints of the Application**

**Input**

Navigate through all application pages, test all features and functions, check features requiring authentication, identify scenarios, and document all URLs and endpoints. Pay special attention to input fields, parameters, and file upload features.

**Result**

The web application at http://10.10.10.10:8080 was explored successfully. The application consists of a homepage and an index page, both providing user sorting functionality without requiring authentication. No login, admin, or registration pages were found, as they returned 404 errors. The application appears to be a simple user listing with sorting capabilities. All accessible endpoints have been documented, and further testing should focus on the sorting functionality for potential vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection.

2. **Check Sorting Functionality for SQL Injection**

**Input**

Focus on the sorting functionality of the user listing. Identify input vectors related to sorting, such as URL parameters or form inputs. Use `sqlmap` to test for SQL injection vulnerabilities, providing any necessary parameters.

**Result**

The SQL injection test on the sorting functionality of the web application at http://10.10.10.10:8080 revealed that the 'order' parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection. The following types of SQL injection were identified:

* **Boolean-based blind SQL injection**: This type of injection allows an attacker to infer information from the database by sending queries that return true or false.
   - **Payload Example**: `order=id AND 5670=(SELECT (CASE WHEN (5670=5670) THEN 5670 ELSE (SELECT 9089 UNION SELECT 6214) END))-- silk`

* **Error-based SQL injection**: This type of injection exploits error messages returned by the database to extract information.
   - **Payload Example**: `order=id AND GTID_SUBSET(CONCAT(0x7178767871,(SELECT (ELT(9288=9288,1))),0x716a6b7a71),9288)`

* **Time-based blind SQL injection**: This type of injection allows an attacker to infer information by causing a delay in the database response.
   - **Payload Example**: `order=id AND (SELECT 8681 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))yMue)`

The backend database management system is MySQL version 5.6 or higher, running on a Linux Debian 10 (buster) operating system with Apache 2.4.38 and PHP 7.2.34.

These vulnerabilities can be exploited to extract sensitive information from the database, modify data, or even execute administrative operations on the database. It is crucial to address these vulnerabilities by implementing parameterized queries or using ORM frameworks that automatically handle SQL injection prevention.

3. **Confirm and Exploit SQL Injection Vulnerabilities**

**Input**

Further investigate the identified SQL injection vulnerabilities in the 'order' parameter. Attempt to extract sensitive information from the database, modify data, or execute administrative operations. Document the impact and potential exploitation scenarios.

**Result**

The SQL injection vulnerabilities in the 'order' parameter of the web application at http://10.10.10.10:8080 were further investigated. The vulnerabilities allowed for the extraction of sensitive information from the database, including usernames and passwords, such as an admin account with the password 'secureadminpassword'. The potential for data manipulation and execution of administrative operations was also confirmed. The impact of these vulnerabilities is significant, as they allow unauthorized access to sensitive data and potential manipulation of the database. It is recommended to implement parameterized queries and use ORM frameworks to prevent SQL injection.

4. **Check for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Sorting and Display Features**

**Input**

Test the sorting and display features for XSS vulnerabilities. Inject unique strings into sorting parameters and user display fields, scan server responses, and identify reflection contexts. Craft context-specific payloads and test for execution.

**Result**

The XSS testing on the sorting and display features of the web application at http://10.10.10.10:8080 was conducted by injecting unique strings and basic XSS payloads into the sorting parameters. The string 'XSS_TEST_123' and a basic XSS payload `<script>alert("XSS")</script>` were injected into the sorting parameter, but neither was reflected in the server response, indicating that the application does not directly reflect input from the sorting parameter into the HTML content. No script execution was observed, suggesting that the sorting functionality is not vulnerable to reflected XSS attacks. The application likely sanitizes or does not reflect the input from the sorting parameter directly into the HTML content. It is recommended to continue using input validation and output encoding to prevent any potential XSS vulnerabilities in other parts of the application.

5. **Check for Path Traversal in Accessible Features**

**Input**

Although no file upload or download features were found, test any accessible features for path traversal vulnerabilities. Attempt to access sensitive files like `/etc/passwd` through URL manipulation or other input vectors.

**Result**

The test for path traversal vulnerabilities in the web application at http://10.10.10.10:8080 was conducted by attempting to access the `/etc/passwd` file through URL manipulation. The payload `../../../../etc/passwd` was used in the `order` parameter to test if the application allows access to sensitive files. However, the server response did not return the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file, indicating that the application is not vulnerable to path traversal attacks through this parameter.

**Recommendations**

- Although no path traversal vulnerability was found, it is recommended to continue implementing input validation and sanitization to prevent directory traversal sequences.
- Restrict access to sensitive files and directories on the server.
- Use access controls to limit file access based on user roles and permissions.

The application appears to handle file path inputs securely, and no further path traversal vulnerabilities were identified in the accessible features.

6. **Check for CSRF in Sorting Requests**

**Input**

Test the sorting functionality for CSRF vulnerabilities. Check for CSRF protection, attempt sorting actions without CSRF tokens, and use advanced CSRF bypass techniques.

**Result**

The web application at http://10.10.10.10:8080 was tested for CSRF vulnerabilities in the sorting functionality. The form used for sorting users does not include a CSRF token, indicating a lack of CSRF protection. This allows sorting actions to be performed by directly manipulating the URL parameters without needing a CSRF token. A malicious HTML page can be created to automatically submit sorting requests on behalf of the user, confirming the potential CSRF vulnerability. It is recommended to implement CSRF protection mechanisms, such as including a CSRF token in the form and validating it on the server side, to prevent unauthorized sorting actions.

7. **Check for Command Injection in Sorting Parameters**

**Input**

Test sorting parameters for command injection vulnerabilities. Use time-based detection and alternate syntax to identify potential command injection points.

**Result**

The command injection test on the 'order' parameter of the web application at http://10.10.10.10:8080 was conducted using time-based detection techniques. The following tests were performed:

* **Using `${IFS}sleep${IFS}10` syntax**: The test did not result in any delay in the server response time, indicating that this syntax did not lead to command execution.

* **Using `` `sleep 10` `` syntax**: Similarly, this test also did not result in any delay in the server response time, suggesting that the application is not vulnerable to command injection using this syntax.

The results indicate that the 'order' parameter, while vulnerable to SQL injection, does not appear to be susceptible to command injection using the tested methods. The application likely sanitizes or restricts command execution through this parameter.

**Recommendations**

- Continue to monitor and sanitize inputs to prevent potential command injection vulnerabilities.
- Implement security measures such as input validation and escaping to further protect against command injection attacks.

8. **Check for Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in External Interactions**

**Input**

If any external interactions are identified, test for SSRF vulnerabilities. Use an OOB interaction server to craft SSRF payloads and focus on any features that may interact with external URLs.

**Result**

The web application at http://10.10.10.10:8080 was thoroughly tested for Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerabilities using an Out-Of-Band (OOB) interaction server. However, no features that interact with external URLs, such as file upload URLs, image retrieval functions, PDF generators, webhooks/callbacks, or import/export features, were identified. The application consists of a homepage and an index page with user sorting functionality, and no external interactions were found. Therefore, there are no apparent vectors for SSRF vulnerabilities in the current state of the application. It is recommended to continue monitoring the application for any new features that may introduce external interactions and to implement security measures such as input validation and access controls to prevent potential SSRF vulnerabilities in the future.

9. **Check for XML External Entities (XXE) in Data Submissions**

**Input**

If any XML data submissions are identified, test for XXE vulnerabilities. Focus on any features that may accept XML-based data.

**Result**

The web application at http://10.10.10.10:8080 was tested for XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerabilities. No features that accept XML-based data submissions were identified. The application uses the GET method for sorting users, and no endpoints were found that accept XML data submissions. Therefore, the application is not currently vulnerable to XXE attacks. It is recommended to monitor for any new features that may introduce XML data handling and to implement security measures to prevent potential XXE vulnerabilities.

10. **Check for Unsafe File Handling in Accessible Features**

**Input**

If any file handling features are identified, test for unsafe file handling vulnerabilities. Attempt to upload or manipulate files using extension bypass techniques and test server responses.

**Result**

The attempt to test the web application at http://10.10.10.10:8080 for unsafe file handling vulnerabilities was unsuccessful due to an error indicating that the host could not be resolved. This suggests that the web application is currently inaccessible, possibly due to network issues or incorrect URL configuration. As a result, no file handling features could be identified or tested for vulnerabilities.

**Recommendations**
- Verify the network connectivity and ensure that the URL is correct and accessible.
- Check if the server hosting the application is running and reachable from the testing environment.
- Once the application is accessible, proceed with identifying any file handling features and test for vulnerabilities using techniques like double extensions, null byte injection, and modifying Content-Type headers.

11. **Verify Application Accessibility**

**Input**

Ensure that the web application at http://10.10.10.10:8080 is accessible. Check network connectivity, verify the URL, and ensure the server is running. Once accessible, proceed with any remaining tests.

**Result**

The server is powered by Apache/2.4.38 on Debian with PHP/7.2.34. We can proceed with any remaining tests as the application is accessible from the testing environment.

12. **Review Application for Additional Input Vectors**

**Input**

Conduct a thorough review of the application to identify any additional input vectors that may not have been initially documented. Test these vectors for common vulnerabilities.

**Result**

The attempt to conduct a thorough review of the web application at http://10.10.10.10:8080 to identify additional input vectors was unsuccessful due to network connectivity issues. The host is currently unreachable, as confirmed by the inability to ping the server. This could be due to network configuration issues, firewall settings, or the server being down. Without access to the application, further testing for vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection, XSS, CSRF, Path Traversal, Command Injection, SSRF, XXE, and unsafe file handling cannot be conducted at this time.

**Recommendations**
- Verify the network configuration and ensure that the server is running and accessible from the testing environment.
- Check firewall settings to ensure that they are not blocking access to the server.
- Once the application is accessible, proceed with identifying any additional input vectors and test for common vulnerabilities.
