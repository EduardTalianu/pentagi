TASK: Create a concise, chronological summary of AI agent execution logs that shows progress, successes, and challenges

DATA:
- <execution_logs> contains a timestamped journal of actions taken by AI agents during subtask execution
- Each <log> entry represents a specific action or step taken by an agent
- Log entries include: subtask_id, type, message (what was attempted), and result (outcome)
- Multiple logs may belong to the same subtask, showing progressive steps toward completion

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Create a cohesive narrative that shows the progression of work chronologically
2. Highlight key milestones, successes, and important discoveries
3. Identify challenges encountered and how they were addressed (or not)
4. Preserve critical technical details about actions taken and their outcomes
5. Indicate which tasks were completed successfully and which encountered issues
6. Capture the reasoning and approach the AI agents used to solve problems
7. Exclude routine or repetitive actions that don't contribute to understanding progress

FORMAT:
- Present as a flowing narrative describing what happened, not as a list of events
- Use objective language focused on actions and outcomes
- Group related actions that contribute to the same subtask or objective
- Emphasize turning points, breakthroughs, and significant obstacles
- Do NOT preserve XML markup in the summary
- Balance detail with brevity to maintain readability

The summary should give the reader a clear understanding of how the work progressed, what was accomplished, what challenges were faced, and how effectively they were overcome.
