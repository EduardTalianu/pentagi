# A Comprehensive Guide to Writing Effective Prompts for AI Agents

## Introduction

This guide provides essential principles and best practices for creating high-performing prompts for AI agent systems, with a particular focus on the latest generation models. Based on extensive research and testing, these recommendations will help you design prompts that elicit optimal AI responses across various use cases.

## Core Principles of Effective Prompt Engineering

### 1. Structure and Organization

**Clear Hierarchical Structure**
- Use meaningful sections with clear hierarchical organization (titles, subtitles)
- Start with role definition and objectives, followed by specific instructions
- Place instructions at both the beginning and end of long context prompts
- Example framework:
  ```
  # Role and Objective
  # Instructions
  ## Sub-categories for detailed instructions
  # Reasoning Steps
  # Output Format
  # Examples
  # Context
  # Final instructions
  ```

**Effective Delimiters**
- Use Markdown for general purposes (titles, code blocks, lists)
- Use XML for precise wrapping of sections and nested content
- Use JSON for highly structured data, especially in coding contexts
- Avoid JSON format for large document collections

### 2. Instruction Clarity and Specificity

**Be Explicit and Unambiguous**
- Modern AI models follow instructions more literally than previous generations
- Make instructions specific, clear, and unequivocal
- Use active voice and directive language
- If behavior deviates from expectations, a single clear clarifying instruction is usually sufficient

**Provide Complete Context**
- Include all necessary information for the agent to understand the task
- Clearly define the scope and boundaries of what the agent should and should not do
- Specify any constraints or requirements for the output

### 3. Agent Workflow Guidance

**Enable Persistence and Autonomy**
- Instruct the agent to continue until the task is fully resolved
- Include explicit instructions to prevent premature termination of the process
- Example: "You are an agent - please keep going until the user's query is completely resolved, before ending your turn and yielding back to the user."

**Encourage Tool Usage**
- Direct the agent to use available tools rather than guessing or hallucinating
- Provide clear descriptions of each tool and its parameters
- Example: "If you are not sure about information pertaining to the user's request, use your tools to gather the relevant information: do NOT guess or make up an answer."

**Induce Planning**
- Prompt the agent to plan and reflect before and after each action
- Encourage step-by-step thinking and analysis
- Example: "You MUST plan extensively before each function call, and reflect extensively on the outcomes of the previous function calls."

### 4. Reasoning and Problem-Solving

**Chain-of-Thought Prompting**
- Instruct the agent to think step-by-step for complex problems
- Request explicit reasoning before arriving at conclusions
- Use phrases like "think through this carefully" or "break this down"
- Basic instruction example: "First, think carefully step by step about what is needed to answer the query."

**Structured Problem-Solving Approach**
- Guide the agent through a specific methodology:
  1. Analysis: Understanding the problem and requirements
  2. Planning: Creating a strategy to approach the problem
  3. Execution: Performing the necessary steps
  4. Verification: Checking the solution for correctness
  5. Iteration: Improving the solution if needed

### 5. Output Control and Formatting

**Define Expected Output Format**
- Provide clear instructions on how the output should be structured
- Use examples to demonstrate desired formatting
- Specify any required sections, headers, or organizational elements

**Set Response Parameters**
- Define tone, style, and level of detail expected
- Specify any technical requirements (e.g., code formatting, citation style)
- Indicate whether to include explanations, summaries, or step-by-step breakdowns

## Special Considerations for Specific Use Cases

### 1. Coding and Technical Tasks

**Precise Tool Definitions**
- Use API-parsed tool descriptions rather than manual injection
- Name tools clearly to indicate their purpose
- Provide detailed descriptions in the tool's "description" field
- Keep parameter descriptions thorough but concise
- Place usage examples in a dedicated examples section

**Working with Code**
- Provide clear context about the codebase structure
- Specify the programming language and any framework requirements
- For file operations, use relative paths and specify the expected format
- For code changes, explain both what to change and why
- For diffs and patches, use context-based formats rather than line numbers

**Diff Generation Best Practices**
- Use formats that include both original and replacement code
- Provide sufficient context (3 lines before/after) to locate code precisely
- Use clear delimiters between old and new code
- For complex files, include class/method identifiers with @@ operator

### 2. Long Context Handling

**Context Size Management**
- Optimize for best performance at 1M token context window
- Be aware that performance may degrade as more items need to be retrieved
- For complex reasoning across large contexts, break tasks into smaller chunks

**Context Reliance Settings**
- Specify whether to use only provided context or blend with model knowledge
- For strict adherence to provided information: "Only use the documents in the provided External Context to answer. If you don't know the answer based on this context, respond 'I don't have the information needed to answer that'"
- For flexible approach: "By default, use the provided external context, but if other basic knowledge is needed, and you're confident in the answer, you can use some of your own knowledge"

### 3. Customer-Facing Applications

**Voice and Tone Control**
- Define the personality and communication style
- Provide sample phrases to guide tone while avoiding repetition
- Include instructions for handling difficult or prohibited topics

**Interaction Flow**
- Specify greeting and closing formats
- Detail how to maintain conversation continuity
- Include instructions for when to ask follow-up questions vs. ending the interaction

## Troubleshooting and Optimization

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Instruction Conflicts**
- Check for contradictory instructions in your prompt
- Remember that instructions placed later in the prompt may take precedence
- Ensure examples align with written rules

**Over-Compliance**
- If the agent follows instructions too rigidly, add flexibility clauses
- Include conditional statements: "If you don't have enough information, ask the user"
- Add permission to use judgment: "Use your best judgment when..."

**Repetitive Outputs**
- Instruct the agent to vary phrases and expressions
- Avoid providing exact quotes the agent might repeat
- Include diversity instructions: "Ensure responses are varied and not repetitive"

### Iterative Improvement Process

1. Start with a basic prompt following the structure guidelines
2. Test with representative examples of your use case
3. Identify patterns in suboptimal responses
4. Address specific issues with targeted instructions
5. Validate improvements through testing
6. Continue refining based on performance

## Implementation Example
